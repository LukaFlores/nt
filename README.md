<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Dotfiles are highly personalized to the individual. I encourage anyone who is starting the process of creating dotfiles to find inspiration in the others whilst starting from scratch. 

Note: Before installing, please look through the code and understand. It will alter prexisting configurations.

## Config

At the top of the file there are changeable variables

```
fileType=".tex"
subDir="agnDir" # Directory Containing Notes / Assignments for Specifc Application
homeDirectory=~/notes/edu # Directory Containing all Applications of "nt"
databaseTXT="completed-assignments.txt" # Name of File to Store Complete Assignments / Notes
IPdatabaseTXT="inprogress-assignments.txt" # Name of File to Store Assignments / Notes that are In Progress
```
For example I currently have two commands for two different directories 
``
ag # Responsible for all School Assignment
``
``
nt # Responsible for all Personal Study Notes
``
Example of the way I have structure my personal system

```
~/notes

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Depending on the bin command associated with the file it as simple as calling it, in the video example above I use "ag" but within my dotfiles I also use "nt" for my personal notes directory 

```
  ag
```
or
```
  nt
```
